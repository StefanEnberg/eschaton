== Whats the deal?

Helps with Javascript, Ajax and general scripting in rails.

Its about writing Ruby instead of Javascript, works in a similar manner to Rails PrototypeHelper and ScriptaculousHelper.

See ActionView::Base and ActionView::Helpers::PrototypeHelper::JavaScriptGenerator for extentions provided by
eschaton, the rest is up to you!

== How do I write a plugin ???

The whole point of eschaton is to write plugins that provide the extentions you need where you need them!
Much like rails many conventions are used to make life easy, so here is how you get into the groove of writing them!
