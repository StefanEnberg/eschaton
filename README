== Whats the deal?

Helps with Javascript, Ajax and general scripting in rails.

Its about Ruby instead of Javascript, works in a similar manner to Rails PrototypeHelper and ScriptaculousHelper.

See ActionView::Base and ActionView::Helpers::PrototypeHelper::JavaScriptGenerator for extentions provided by
eschaton, the rest is up to you!

- Small snippets of javascript!
- Ruby used to generate small snippets(no more that 4 - 5 lines)
- Page behaviour abstractions written in Ruby, these generate the javascript
- Ajax related goodies and Presentaion related ajac and javascript
